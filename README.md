![Application Screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marodriguezd/SRT4U_Subtitle-Processor/main/assets/demo-screenshot.png)

A native desktop application built with PyQt6 for processing subtitle files with translation and cleaning capabilities. Features a modern dark theme interface with intuitive controls.

## Features  

- **Robust SRT/VTT Support**:  
   - Import and process SRT or VTT files, even with common formatting errors.
   - The app automatically handles non-standard files, correcting issues like missing index numbers or incorrect timestamp separators.
   - Export processed subtitles in your chosen format (SRT or VTT).  

- **Smart Translation System**:  
   - Translate subtitles into dozens of languages while preserving the original timing structure.
   - Optimized translation calls ensure maximum reliability and timing integrity for each subtitle block.
   - Auto-detection of the source language for optimal translation quality.

- **Advanced Subtitle Cleaning**:  
   - Automatically removes spam content, promotional messages, and unwanted text.
   - Filters out Telegram links, promotional URLs, and subtitle credits.
   - Cleans musical notes and formatting tags that interfere with readability.

- **Native Desktop Experience**:  
   - Built with PyQt6 for native look and feel across all platforms.
   - Modern dark theme interface with intuitive controls.
   - Native file dialogs for seamless file and directory selection.  
   - Real-time progress tracking with detailed status messages.
   - Responsive threading to keep the UI smooth during processing.

- **Output Format Flexibility**:  
   - Choose between SRT or VTT output format regardless of the input format.
   - Automatic format conversion with proper headers (WEBVTT for VTT files).
   - Preserves timing precision and ensures correct subtitle numbering.

## Important Notes  

### Format Tolerance
SRT4U is designed to be highly tolerant of common subtitle file issues. It can automatically parse and correct:
- Files with **missing subtitle index numbers**.
- Files using non-standard timestamp separators (e.g., `00:00:00 - 00:01:00` instead of `00:00:00,000 --> 00:01:00,000`).
- Inconsistent line endings or extra blank lines.

### About VTT File Processing  
Internally, SRT4U processes subtitle files in a standardized SRT-like format. If you import a VTT file with additional features such as styles, positioning, or other metadata, these will be **stripped out during processing** to ensure compatibility.  
- The application ensures that text content and timing are perfectly preserved.  
- However, **styles or metadata specific to VTT will not be retained** when exporting back to VTT.

## Installation & Requirements

### System Requirements
- **Python 3.8 or later**
- **Windows, macOS, or Linux**
- **Internet connection** (required for the translation feature)

### Dependencies Installation

Install required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Or install manually:
```bash
pip install PyQt6>=6.4.0 deep-translator>=1.11.4
```

### Quick Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:  
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/marodriguezd/SRT4U_Subtitle-Processor.git
   cd SRT4U_Subtitle-Processor  
   ```  

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the application**:

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"No module named 'PyQt6'" Error**
```bash
pip install PyQt6>=6.4.0
```

**Translation Not Working**  
- Check your internet connection.
- Verify the language code is correct (e.g., `es`, not `spanish`). The translation service may have temporarily blocked your IP due to high request volume.

**Input File Issues**
- **SRT4U is designed to handle most format errors automatically.** If a file still fails, it may be severely corrupted. Ensure it contains recognizable timestamp lines.
- Check file encoding (UTF-8 is recommended).

**UI Not Responding**
- Large files may take a moment to process.
- Check the progress bar for updates. Translation of very long subtitles can take several minutes.

### Performance Tips

- **For large files**: Processing may take 1-3 minutes depending on file size and whether translation is enabled.
- **Translation speed**: Depends on the number of subtitle blocks and internet connection stability.
- **Memory usage**: Minimal, even with large subtitle files.
