## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"No module named 'PyQt6'" Error**
```bash
pip install PyQt6>=6.4.0
```

**Translation Not Working**  
- Check your internet connection
- Verify the language code is correct (e.g., 'es', not 'spanish')
- Some languages may have limited support

**File Not Processing**
- Ensure the subtitle file has valid SRT/VTT format
- Check file encoding (UTF-8 recommended)
- Verify file permissions

**UI Not Responding**
- Large files may take time to process
- Check the progress bar for updates
- Translation of very long subtitles may take several minutes

### Performance Tips

- **For large files**: Processing may take 2-5 minutes depending on file size
- **Translation speed**: Depends on subtitle count and internet connection
- **Memory usage**: Minimal, even with large subtitle files

## Translate, Clean, and Convert SRT/VTT Subtitles  

![Application Screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marodriguezd/SRT4U_Subtitle-Processor/main/assets/demo-screenshot.png)

A native desktop application built with PyQt6 for processing subtitle files with translation and cleaning capabilities. Features a modern dark theme interface with intuitive controls.

## Features  

- **Support for SRT and VTT Formats**:  
   - Import and process SRT or VTT subtitle files with native file dialogs.  
   - Export processed subtitles in your chosen format (SRT or VTT).  
   - ⚠️ **Note**: VTT files with additional styles or metadata will be converted to plain text during processing (see **Important Notes** below).  

- **Smart Translation System**:  
   - Translate subtitles into multiple languages while preserving original timing structure.
   - Batch processing for efficient API usage and faster translation.
   - Auto-detection of source language for optimal translation quality.

- **Advanced Subtitle Cleaning**:  
   - Automatically removes spam content, promotional messages, and unwanted text.
   - Filters out Telegram links, promotional URLs, and subtitle credits.
   - Cleans musical notes and formatting tags that interfere with readability.

- **Native Desktop Experience**:  
   - Built with PyQt6 for native look and feel across all platforms.
   - Modern dark theme interface with intuitive controls.
   - Native file dialogs for seamless file and directory selection.  
   - Real-time progress tracking with detailed status messages.
   - Responsive threading to keep the UI smooth during processing.

- **Output Format Flexibility**:  
   - Choose between SRT or VTT output format regardless of input format.
   - Automatic format conversion with proper headers (WEBVTT for VTT files).
   - Preserves timing precision and subtitle numbering.

## Important Notes  

### About VTT File Processing  
Internally, SRT4U processes subtitle files in the **SRT format**. If you import a VTT file with additional features such as styles, metadata, or non-standard properties, these will be **stripped out during processing**.  
- The application ensures that translations and basic formatting are preserved.  
- However, **styles, positioning, or metadata specific to VTT will not be retained** when exporting back to VTT.  

This design ensures maximum compatibility across formats and simplifies translation and processing tasks.

### Quick Start Guide

1. **Launch the Application**
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Select Your Subtitle File**
