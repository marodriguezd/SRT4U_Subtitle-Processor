**SRT4U v3.0 - Your Premium Desktop Subtitle Processor**

SRT4U v3.0 marks a revolutionary leap forward with a **completely redesigned native desktop interface**. This powerful subtitle processing application now delivers professional-grade performance through a sleek, modern desktop experience. Whether you need to **translate subtitles into multiple languages**, **clean unwanted spam**, or **convert between formats** (SRT/VTT), SRT4U v3.0 provides lightning-fast results with an intuitive, native Windows interface.

### Important Note About VTT Files:
Internally, SRT4U processes subtitle files using the **SRT format**. If you provide a **VTT file** with additional styles, metadata, or features, these will be **stripped out during processing**. We ensure your translations and essential formatting are preserved, but any non-standard VTT features will be removed when converting back to VTT.
